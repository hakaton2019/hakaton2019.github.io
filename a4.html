                <h1 class="font-weight-light">Top reasons to adopt a pet</h1>
                <p class="lead">We put together a list of common adoption myths, in the hopes that you can gently point
                    friends toward this post when they talk about adding a pet to their family.</p>
                <p class="lead"><strong>Myth #1: I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m getting</strong><br />
                    There may in fact be more information available about an adoptable pet than one from a breeder or pet store.</p>
                <p class="lead">Many of the pets posted on this website are in foster care. Foster parents live with their
                    charges 24-7 and can often tell you, in detail, about the pet&#8217;s personality and habits. If the
                    pet is at a shelter, the staff or volunteers may be able to tell you what he or she is like.</p>
                <p class="lead">At the very least, you can ask the staff if the pet was an owner surrender (rather than a stray)
                    and, if so, what the former owner said about him or her. Quite often pets are given up because the owner faced
                    financial or housing issues (more on that later). You can also ask about the health and behavioral evaluations
                    the pet has undergone since arriving at the shelter. In contrast, pet store owners rarely have an idea of what
                    a pet will be like in a home.</p>
                <p class="lead"><strong>Myth #2: I can&#8217;t find what I want at a shelter</strong></p>
                <p class="lead"><strong></strong>If you can&#8217;t find the pet you&#8217;re looking for on our website,
                    don&#8217;t give up. Some shelters maintain waiting lists for specific breeds, so don&#8217;t be afraid
                    to ask! There are also breed-specific rescues for just about every breed, and most of them post their pets
                    here.</p>
                <p class="lead"><strong>Myth #3: I can get a free pet, so why pay an adoption fee?</strong></p>
                <p class="lead"><strong></strong>According to the National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy
                    (via the ASPCA), approximately 65% of pet parents in the U.S. get their pets for free or at low cost,
                    and most pets are obtained from acquaintances or family members. The NCPPSP also reports that pets acquired
                    from friends make up more than 30% of pets surrendered to shelters.</p>
                <p class="lead">While getting a &#8220;free&#8221; pet may seem like a bargain at first, you&#8217;re then
                    responsible for veterinary costs that shelters and rescue groups usually cover, including:</p>
                <ul class="lead">
                    <li>Spaying/neutering $150-300</li>
                    <li>Distemper vaccination $20-30 x2</li>
                    <li>Rabies vaccination $15-25</li>
                    <li>Heartworm test $15-35</li>
                    <li>Flea/tick treatment $50-200</li>
                    <li>Microchip $50</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="lead"><strong>Myth #4: Pets are in shelters because they didn&#8217;t make good pets</strong></p>
                <p class="lead">In fact, the main reasons pets are given up include:</p>
                <ul class="lead">
                    <li>Owners are moving to housing that don&#8217;t allow pets (7% dogs, 8% cats)</li>
                    <li>Allergies (8% cats)</li>
                    <li>Owner having personal problems (4% dogs and cats)</li>
                    <li>Too many or no room for litter mates (7% dogs, 17% cats)</li>
                    <li>Owner can no longer afford the pet (5% dogs, 6% cats)</li>
                    <li>Owner no longer has time for the pet (4% dogs)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="lead"><strong>Myth #5: Shelter pets have too much baggage</strong></p>
                <p class="lead">Rescued pets have full histories &#8230; something that can actually be GREAT for adopters.
                    Remember, all pets&#8211; even eight-week old puppies and kittens &#8212; have distinct personalities.
                    Those personalities will either jive with your home and lifestyle or not.  Work with rescue group or shelter
                    staff to find the right fit for you.</p>
